## üß© TODOs

* [ ] **Support remote image specification**
  Currently, the `image` field assumes local files under `assets/images/people/`. We plan to add support for referencing remote images via full URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/avatar.jpg`).
* [ ] **Synchronize thesis information**
  Synchronize the thesis entry with the bib entry in [https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/Literature](https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/Literature).
